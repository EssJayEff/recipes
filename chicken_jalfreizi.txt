Dice chicken breast (I use about 600g for 4 people) and marinate in 1 
teaspoon of tumeric, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of chilli flakes.

Leave for at least 30mins plus to develop flavours.

Saute 2 onions roughly chopped in oil - recipe suggests 50mls but I cut this down and use coconut oil just a spoonful.

Add the chicken and reduce the heat and stir until browed.

Add 1-2 teaspoons of ground cumin and 1 teaspoon of ground coriander and stir in.

Add some chopped peppers (about 1 large - I use a combination of red/green/yellow - just what I have) and 1-2 chopped green chillis - to 
taste. 

Then add about 3 chopped tomatoes or a can of chopped tomatoes and simmer with a lid on for about 20 minutes.

Add 1 teaspoon each of garlic and ginger - crushed, grated or use paste and 1-2 tablespoons of tomato paste. 

At this stage you can also add a little water if curry looking dry.

Simmer for about 7-10 mins and then add 1 teaspoon of garam marsala and cook out for about 5 mins.

Ready to serve now with naan bread or rice - I like to serve mine with fresh spinach too which wilts down quickly if I add at the end.
